# use-Flatbuffers-encoding-to-store-data-on-a-LittleFS-partition-of-an-ESP32
This code uses the Flatbuffers library to encode and decode the Melody structure. The Flatbuffers library is a cross-platform serialization library that can be used to encode and decode data in a compact and efficient way.


The code first generates a random melody and writes it to the LittleFS filesystem on the ESP32. The melody is encoded using the Flatbuffers library.

The code then reads the melody from the LittleFS filesystem and prints the label and embedded tones. The melody is decoded using the Flatbuffers library.

This code can be compiled and run on any ESP32 MCU. To compile the code, you will need to install the PlatformIO development environment. Once you have installed PlatformIO, you can open the code in the PlatformIO IDE and compile it.

To run the code, you will need to upload it to the ESP32 MCU. You can do this using the PlatformIO IDE or the ESP-IDF command-line tools.

Once the code is running, you will be able to generate a random melody and play it back.
